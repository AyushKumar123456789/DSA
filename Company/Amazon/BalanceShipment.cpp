Problem Statement:

Amazon has multiple delivery centers for the distribution of its goods. In one such center, parcels are arranged in a sequence where the
ùëñ
ith parcel has a weight of weight[i]. A shipment is constituted of a contiguous segment of parcels in this arrangement. For example, if the parcels are arranged with weights [3, 6, 3], a shipment can be formed from parcels with weights [3], [6], [3], [3, 6], [6, 3], [3, 6, 3], but not with weights [3, 3]. These shipments are to be loaded for delivery and must be balanced.

A shipment is said to be balanced if the weight of the last parcel of the shipment is not the maximum weight among all the weights in that shipment. For example, a shipment with weights [3, 9, 4, 7] is balanced since the last weight is 7, while the maximum weight in the shipment is 9. However, the shipment [4, 7, 2, 7] is not balanced because the last weight (7) is the maximum weight in that shipment.

Task:

Given the weights of
ùëõ
n parcels placed in a sequence, find the maximum number of balanced shipments that can be formed such that each parcel belongs to exactly one shipment. Each shipment must consist of only a contiguous segment of parcels, and each shipment must be balanced. If there are no balanced shipments, return 0.

Example :
1 2 3 2 6 3

Ans: 1 2 3 2  & 6 3
